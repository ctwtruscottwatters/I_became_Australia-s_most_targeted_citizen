I write in urgency because I am in danger. I apologize for the profanity I
am unable to remove. Two nights ago I awoke to find my notes and other
items missing from my room. I was not able to walk the next day, falling
over frequently. Two days have passed and I am in constant pain, my muscles
are aching and I can no longer walk well, I have no where to go and I am
hoping to find medical assistance, though I know that it is an extreme to
consider that my case would allow for such. I imagine that the cult, the
group, the party, has poisoned me. I have nowhere to go, but I will catch a
flight somewhere. I have not been able to fully clarify my account of the
events and included in the video is a incorrect account so far as
recognizing the correct times of events, I am still working on that.

I am unable to speak, barely, and it is hard to experience this.
